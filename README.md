# **Swund – Production-Grade Farcaster Mini App on Celo**

Swund is a **production-ready boilerplate and toolkit** for building high-quality **Farcaster mini apps on Celo** — designed to help developers ship fast, reliable, and scalable social experiences **in days, not months**.

It powers Farcaster Frames and mini apps that feel native, load instantly, and leverage **Celo’s low-cost, mobile-first infrastructure**.
Whether you're building social trading tools, onchain games, dashboards, or AI agents — **Swund accelerates everything** with battle-tested patterns extracted from real production apps.

**Repository:** [https://github.com/Thycrescendo/swund](https://github.com/Thycrescendo/swund)
**Deployments:** Example contracts deployed on Celo Alfajores & Mainnet
**Status:** Ready for mainnet — **zero to production in one command**

## 🚀 What Swund Enables

Build Farcaster mini apps that are:

* ⚡ **Instant-loading** (Next.js + optimized Celo SDK)
* 🤖 **AI-ready** — integrate Grok, Claude, or onchain LLMs
* 📱 **Mobile-first** — feels native inside Warpcast
* 🔐 **Secure & cheap** — powered by Celo’s ultra-low fees
* 🟣 **Social-native** — deep Farcaster + Neynar integrations

## ❗ The Problem Swund Solves

Most Farcaster mini apps today are:

* Slow to load, especially on mobile
* Expensive or fragile as interactions scale
* Hard to take from MVP → production
* Missing reusable patterns for auth, payments, storage, AI

**Swund fixes all of this** with a complete, production-hardened stack trusted by top builders.

## 🧩 Core Features (Ready Out-of-the-Box)

* **Frames v2 Ready** → Fully compliant (Neynar + Airstack SDKs)
* **Celo WalletKit + Social Connect** → One-tap login (phone/email)
* **Mini App Router** → Optimized for Warpcast embedded UX
* **Onchain Payments** → Instant stablecoin transfers (cUSD, USDC)
* **AI Integration Layer** → Grok API, OpenRouter, or local models
* **Persistent Storage** → Tableland + Ceramic (IndexedDB fallback)
* **Responsive UI** → Tailwind-based, perfect for mobile mini apps
