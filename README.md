## 🧩 The Problem It Solves
Trading on Farcaster today is broken:  
- Frames are toys, not real trading tools  
- Centralized apps kill the vibe and cost a fortune in fees  
- Alpha lives in casts, but you still have to leave to trade  

Hundle brings the entire trading experience into Warpcast, powered by Celo — fast, cheap, social, and fully onchain.
